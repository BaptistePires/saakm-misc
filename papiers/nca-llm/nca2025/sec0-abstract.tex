Scheduling plays a critical parts in applications performance and must not be looked upon. However, writing schedulers can be a long and tedious task. There are efforts made over the past years to provide APIs and frameworks to ease the process of writing scheduling policies. In this paper we present SaaKM, a small kernel APIs to write scheduling policies as Linux kernel modules. Our goal is to remove the barriers to write schedulers. We compare our solution to the recently merged ext scheduling class. SaaKM performs simlilarly using a per-cpu FIFO scheduler.
