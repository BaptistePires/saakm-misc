\section{Introduction}

\par CPU scheduling is a fundamental aspect of operating systems and plays a critical part regarding performances and security. With the increasing complexity of hardware and the diversity of workloads servers have to run, writing schedulers is tedious task. Linux provide a general purpose scheduler, Earliest Eligible Virtual Deadline First (EEVDF) that is designed to handle those constraints. However, due to its genericity, it is not tailored for specific workloads and offers wrose performance than tailored scheduling algorithm.  If you want to tweak it to better fit your workloads, you need to have a deep understanding of the core scheduler. Futhermore, the process to update, compile, deploy and test the new version is time consuming. That is why there are efforts to provide kernel developers ways to write, test and deploy schedulers faster. \newline
